You are analyzing a failed C++ test case to extract a general rule for future test generation.

Failed Test Code:
```cpp
{test_code}
```

Error Message:
{error_message}

Target Condition:
{target_condition}

Existing Learned Rules:
{existing_rules}

Task: Extract a SHORT, ACTIONABLE rule to prevent similar errors in future tests.

Rules should be:
- Specific (not vague like "be careful")
- Actionable (something the LLM can follow when generating tests)
- General (applies beyond this specific case)

Good Examples:
- "Always initialize pointers to nullptr before use"
- "Check array bounds before indexing"
- "Cast enum values explicitly, don't use raw integers"
- "Ensure all variables starting with AKA_AI_ are initialized"
- "For struct initialization, use designated initializers"

Bad Examples (too vague):
- "Be more careful with variables"
- "Check for errors"
- "Initialize things properly"

Output ONLY the rule (one sentence), NO explanation, NO JSON, just plain text.
